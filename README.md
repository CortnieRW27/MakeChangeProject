#MakeChangeProject
Overview

If I am being honest, I struggled with a few things this weekend, I over thought the process for only being in class one week. I think that shows in my approach. I got it to produce the answers but with more code than I probably needed. I went through each thing we learned this past week and thought about how they would or could be applied to the project to output the right answers. I started off trying to attack it by using a “method”, but quickly realized I will need more time to understand them before adding them to my program. I decided that I would write an “if” statement to go through the different money denominations and producing the answer. I hit a roadblock when I realized the way I wrote it wouldn’t allow me to not produce “you get zero money back”, at this point I had made it too far on what I had, and the weekend was coming to an end. I left it that way but plan to continue to work on it. I also had a little bit of an issue when it came to the remaining money at the end. I had high hopes I would have eventually caught on and figured it about completely but unfortunately wasn’t able to. I will say, I learned quite a bit going through the process. Something positive, I feel more comfortable with starting the process, in class I was feeling nervous to even start drills and labs, this weekend really helped me to realize I need to just start and I’ll get it along the way. I wish I would have grasped this assignment better than I did. However, I am going to let it drive me to work harder and be more proficient at getting my programs to work.

Technologies Used
-Java -Eclipse -Git

Lessons Learned

I learned more about each topic covered in class. I went through and read everything again to get a better understanding. I learned more about the “truncating, floor, ceiling, and rounding” with java because I needed to use it to make my program work. I really started to see how certain things are important, for example, when trying to create an “if” statement I couldn’t have variables that weren’t used in that specific statement while they were initialized in another “if” statement.
